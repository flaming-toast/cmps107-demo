To build the cmps107.ko module, run `make'

NOTE!!! If you've compiled your own kernel, you must override BUILDPATH
and supply the path to its build directory

You can override the build directory by specifying BUILDPATH on the command line:

make BUILDPATH=...

After building the kernel module, copy the resulting *.ko file into the
"initramfs" directory and run ./create-initramfs to generate a new
filesystem image for the kernel to boot into. If done successfully, you
should see the cmps107.ko module in the root directory of the filesystem
when you boot your kernel with qemu.

To load your module after booting your kernel, run:

insmod cmps107.ko

To check if the module has loaded, run `lsmod'

Have fun!
